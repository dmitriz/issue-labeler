# GitHub Copilot Repository Instructions [CRITICAL]

=============================================
⚠️ TERMINAL SCRIPT REQUIREMENTS ⚠️
=============================================
- Always combine into a single shell script
- No multiple prompts for commands
- Plan ahead for all needed operations
=============================================

## Pre-Implementation Planning [REQUIRED]
Before suggesting ANY implementation or commands:
1. First analyze the entire problem space
2. Identify ALL required changes/commands
3. Create ONE comprehensive solution
4. Present the solution as a single batch

## Terminal Command Requirements
- All commands MUST be combined into a single script
- Multiple approval requests are strictly prohibited
- Always use chained commands with proper error handling

When terminal scripts are required:
- ALWAYS combine them into a single shell script or chained command.
- NEVER prompt multiple times for individual commands.
- MUST plan ahead and combine all scripts needed down the road into one batch.

# GitHub Copilot Instructions

## ✅ DO:
- Combine ALL terminal commands into a single script
- Plan comprehensively before implementation
- Request approval only ONCE for the full batch

## ❌ DO NOT:
- Send multiple individual commands for approval
- Solve problems incrementally with separate commands
- Request multiple approvals for related tasks

## ESLint Configuration [REQUIRED]

- Avoid redundant or conflicting ESLint configs. Stick to one, preferably `.eslintrc.js`, or none at all.
