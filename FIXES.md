# Fixed Issues

## P0 (Must Fix) Issues

### 1. Case Sensitivity Mismatch Between Config and Model Outputs

**Problem:** The system was performing case-sensitive comparisons between configured labels and model outputs, causing silent failures when the case didn't match.

**Fix:** 

- Added case normalization in `config-loader.js` to convert all configured labels to lowercase
- Updated `label-issue.js` to convert model outputs to lowercase before comparison
- Implemented case-insensitive comparison for existing labels

**Tests:**

- Added unit tests specifically for case insensitivity
- Updated E2E tests to verify case-insensitive matching

### 2. Empty Configuration Handling (Backward Compatibility Break)

**Problem:** Empty configurations were not being handled consistently, breaking backward compatibility for users with empty configs.

**Fix:**

- Added legacy mode support through `config.legacy.emptyConfigMeansAllowAll` flag
- Preserved backward compatibility by allowing all labels when in legacy mode
- Default to standard labels ('urgent', 'important') in non-legacy mode

**Tests:**

- Added specific tests for both legacy and non-legacy mode with empty configs
- Verified consistent behavior across different configuration scenarios

## P1 (Should Fix) Issues

### 1. Missing Type Safety for Model Outputs

**Problem:** The system assumed model outputs were always strings, leading to potential runtime errors when non-string values were returned.

**Fix:**

- Added type checking in `github-model.js` when processing model responses
- Implemented proper conversion of non-string values to strings
- Added null/undefined handling for robustness

**Tests:**

- Created dedicated tests for type safety in model outputs
- Covered edge cases like objects, arrays, numbers, and empty strings

## Additional Improvements

1. Improved error handling throughout the code
2. Added more descriptive logging
3. Enhanced test coverage for edge cases
4. Ensured backward compatibility for existing users
5. Applied consistent case handling across the application

These fixes ensure the issue labeler works more reliably and handles a wider range of inputs gracefully.
